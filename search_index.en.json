Many people find it magical, but behind that single line lies an entire universe of complexity. It's not as simple as printing text deep inside the CPU, logic gates are flipping, 1s and 0s are shifting, and layers of computation are unfolding.\nIn this article, we'll explore the computation side of that \"Hello, World!\" moment. And by the end, you might just be surprised at how deep the things are.\nHow computation started\nThe idea of computation began in the human mind as a way to solve complex problems by breaking them into step-by-step instructions that lead to a solution. Eventually, humans began writing these steps down, transforming raw thought into structured logic on paper. This became the earliest form of computational reasoning.\nAs we solved more problems, we started noticing patterns. Many solutions followed similar logical structures. This led to a powerful realization:\nWhat if we could create reusable blocks of logic, like modules, and use them to solve different problems?\nAt the same time, another question emerged:\nWhat kinds of problems can even be broken down like this?\nAnd can we build a model that captures all solvable problems using these logical building blocks?\nThis is where early computation models came into play.\nDFA (Deterministic Finite Automata) and NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automata) fall under the category of Finite Automata. They were designed to follow simple logical flows, essentially acting as pattern recognizers. However, they have no memory, so they can’t handle tasks that require remembering past input.\nThen came Pushdown Automata (PDA). To put it bluntly, it's like simulating prefix or postfix logic on paper. For example, evaluating expressions like + 3 4 or 3 4 +. To do that, you need a temporary memory space, and that's where the stack comes in. PDAs can remember things using this limited memory, allowing them to handle more complex, nested structures like matching brackets or basic code blocks.\nAfter many iterations of exploring such models, in 1936, Alan Turing proposed the Turing Machine, a theoretical model that could simulate any computation process. It wasn’t just a theory he mathematically proved that this machine could represent the logic behind any algorithmically solvable problem.\n\nTuring Machine = Theoretical Blueprint of All Modern Computers\nNow we know the breif history of compuatation and lets see how Turing machine machine became a blueprint of all modern computers\nLike you saw in the above image turing machine is made up of a control unit and a infinite tape, the tape is divided into cells and have 1s and 0s on them\n\nThe control unit which help to read the current tape symbol\nWrites a symbol on the tape\nMoves one position to the left or right\nSwitches to the next state\n\n\nA Turing machine reads a long strip of paper called the tape. This tape contains symbols such as 1s, 0s, or blank spaces. The machine reads one symbol at a time and follows a set of rules that tell it what to do based on the current symbol and its current situation, known as a state. Each rule instructs the machine to change to a new state and then take an action. The action can either be writing a new symbol on the tape or moving one step to the left or right. The machine keeps repeating this process reading a symbol, deciding what to do, writing or moving, and then continuing. However, if it reaches a point where there is no rule that matches the current symbol and state, the machine simply stops. This is called halting.\nSo you might start to wonder, how does all of this actually make sense? Every programming language, at its core, runs on logic. And logic is governed by strict rules. When you write a set of steps or a defined procedure to solve a problem, you are applying those rules in a structured way. That set of steps is called an algorithm. It is not just a bunch of random instructions. It is a rule-based method that ensures the program behaves in a predictable and logical way.\nso still how does turing machine still make sense as a machine? we can actually map the parts of turing machine to modern computers making it equivalent blueprint of modern computers\nTuring Machine PartModern Computer EquivalentExplanation\nTape (infinite in both directions)RAM or storage (finite memory)The Turing Machine uses a tape to read and write data. Computers use memory (like RAM or hard drives) to store and update information.\nHead (reads and writes one cell at a time)CPU read and write operationsThe Turing Machine's head moves left or right, reading and writing one symbol at a time. The CPU reads and writes to memory in a similar step-by-step manner.\nSymbols on the tapeBits, bytes, or instructionsThe Turing Machine works with simple symbols like 0, 1, or blank. Modern computers use binary, machine code, and characters to represent and process data.\nStatesProgram counter or execution stateThe Turing Machine changes states based on input. Computers keep track of what to do next using a program counter and execution state.\nTransition functionProgram logic (like if, while, or switch)The Turing Machine uses rules that say what to do in each situation. In programming, this is like writing conditional logic to control program flow.\nHaltingProgram terminationWhen a Turing Machine halts, it stops working. This is like when a computer program finishes and exits.\nInput on tapeUser input, command-line arguments, or filesTuring Machines take input from the tape. Computers take input from keyboards, files, or other sources.\n\nHow it's all connected\nAs a exaple we discussed how a simple hello world program is actually having lot of things going behind now we know brief about computation lets see how it actually connected by stripping each layer of abstratction\nbasically every programming langauges is based on one another many of know C++ is improved version of C but how does C exist in the first place ? its like pulling all layers of onion to the core of bulb and at core of bulb of every programmimg language is the OG Assembly and assembly is just simplifed version of machine code (which is just 1s and 0s) So, our beloved C language is forst written in assembly and then bootstraped by C itself thik it of like v1 of C is written in assembly and v2 is written with assembly and v1 C so in that way C is a bootstraped language and other languges like python and java are written in C and then bootstraped\nHow a programming language exist in first place ?\nNow that we understand how programming languages came into existence, let’s take a closer look at what really happens when we write a simple program like printing \"Hello, World\". When you use a function like printf(), it may look simple on the surface, but behind the scenes, it follows a defined set of instructions written in a lower-level language like C. These instructions are eventually translated into assembly language, which is closer to how the computer actually works. From there, an assembler turns that into machine code, which the CPU executes directly. That entire chain of logic is what makes the words \"Hello, World\" appear on your screen. It all starts from your code but passes through multiple layers of logic before it reaches the hardware.\nSo let's zoom out a bit and connect above logic to Turing machine which inturns make the Hello world the Turing computable problem\nHow it's connected\n\n\nYou write printf(\"Hello, World\") in a high-level language like C\n\nInput is placed on the Turing Machine tape\n\n\n\nThe compiler reads this code and translates it into lower-level instructions\n\nThe Turing Machine begins in a start state and starts scanning the tape\n\n\n\nThese instructions are converted into assembly language\n\nThe machine moves through defined states based on symbols it reads\n\n\n\nThe assembler takes the assembly code and produces machine code\n\nThe Turing Machine writes new symbols on the tape and changes states accordingly\n\n\n\nThe CPU fetches and executes the machine code\n\nThe machine continues processing until no more rules apply\n\n\n\nWhen execution is done and \"Hello, World\" appears on screen\n\nThe Turing Machine halts after completing the computation\n\n\n\nUnsolvable\nTuring non-computable problems are problems for which no algorithm can solve all possible cases. A classic example is the Busy Beaver problem, which asks for the maximum number of steps a Turing machine of a given size can take before halting. Although some small cases have been solved through decades of effort, the general problem is uncomputable. This means no computer, no matter how powerful, can solve it for all inputs. In real-world terms, these problems resemble programs that loop forever with no predictable end, but not all infinite loops are uncomputable only those proven to have no general solution fall into this category.\nConclusion\nWith every breakthrough in the field of computation, we see new limits of computation defined. Even the current AI is based on Turing principles. At the core, AI is just a big prediction machine, and everything we see is related to computation or feels like a simulation when you observe the world more deeply. The only things that aren’t based on Turing are living beings humans because we act upon emotions and are not governed strictly by a set of rules. When something like that is achieved by AI, it becomes what we call AGI.\nAnd next time you write a piece of code, remember it is not magic, but the result of layers of abstraction hidden beneath all the way down to 1s and 0s, governed by rules.\n","description":"","id":"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/posts/turing/","path":"/posts/turing/","title":"The Code You Write is a Lie"},"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/posts/wsl/":{"body":"Introduction\nBefore we get to the main feature, let's be real. If you're familiar with setting up compilers on Windows, you know what a hassle it is. You try to set up VS Code for a new language, install a bunch of packages, and still don't know whether it will work or not. It just ends in frustration. Sure, some may get it on the first try, but most of us don't. For me specifically, I prefer using the keyboard more than the mouse for everything.I observed something on my college PCs they all used Linux.\nAt first, the majority of people didn't like it or felt it was weird using commands and all. For me, it was different. Instead of using a GUI application for everything, Linux aligned with my principles of minimalism. I also found it was actually quite easy to navigate the system once you got the hang of it.\nThe linux advantsge\nwhy bother with Linux? It started back in the 90s with a dude named Linus Torvalds who wanted to build his own OS for his custom PC components . He wrote the core of it the Linux kernel and from there, countless versions, or \"distros,\" spun out, like Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, Gentoo(This thing really sucks btw) and many others.\nFast forward to today, and Linux is the backbone for countless companies. Their internal systems, cloud servers, and development workflows often run on a Linux-based OS. The reason is simple: it’s free from the control of corporate giants like Microsoft and Apple, and its lightweight nature makes it faster for things like cloud and backend development which are so Heavy.\nFor students like us, learning Linux does two things. First, it improves our understanding of how a PC really works. Second, knowing it signals that you have some real, serious knowledge about computer systems.In short it’s everywhere you don’t see. Windows dominates the visible desktop, but Linux is the skeleton of modern computing and Development\n\nHow I discovered WSL - the best feature of windows\nSo, I started digging deeper into the Linux rabbit hole. At first, I thought the only way I could actually use a Linux distro was to dual-boot, which wasn't a viable option for my laptop, so I almost gave up on the idea.\nBut I was still intrigued. I kept watching videos about the different distros like the OG, Arch Linux, and its famous quote, \"I use Arch, btw.\" I was fascinated by how deeply you could customize the user experience until it felt like the system truly belonged to you.\nThen one day, out of nowhere, I was scrolling through YouTube and found a video by a YouTuber called NetworkChuck titled \"Linux on Windows.\" I thought, \"Okay, fine, let's watch it.\"\nBOOM. That’s when I discovered WSL, the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nIntroducing WSL: The Feature That Changes Everything\nIn simple terms, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is a feature that lets you run a real Linux kernel directly on your Windows system. It uses a built-in virtualization platform called Hyper-V to make this happen. The first version was announced in 2016 and after years of development, it officially launched, enabling developers to finally use a proper Linux environment inside Windows. This makes things way faster and easier, especially for power users.\nAfter I watched a tutorial, I immediately set it up on my laptop. The process was surprisingly easy, but that was just the start. I began learning about package managers (like apt), using sudo, and even writing basic bash scripts. For the first time, I felt like I was discovering what it means to be a \"power user.\"\nThe difference was incredible. I could do almost anything from the terminal. Instead of hunting for .exe files and clicking through setup wizards, I could just install software in seconds with a single command:\n\nI can set up compilers for new languages just with few lines for example for setting up for C compiler i can just do\n\nThat was it. I could open a file in a terminal editor like nvim, write the code, and compile it right there. I remember the real \"aha!\" moment when I needed Jupyter Notebook for a project. I dreaded the heavy Anaconda installation, but in WSL, I had it up and running on my localhost with just a few commands. It just feels so fast, and you can even write simple functions to open websites like Netflix directly from your terminal. It’s a game-changer.\nI spent many nights setting up my WSl and bash scripts now insted of opening and waiting for vscode load i can just have my terminal do everything for me with some lines\n\nMy WSL setup\nConclusion\nSo, my journey started with the familiar frustration of trying to set up a simple C compiler on Windows. It ended with me living in a terminal, feeling completely in control of my workflow, and building things faster than I ever thought possible. The bridge between those two worlds was WSL.\nFor years, it felt like you had to make a choice: the familiar desktop experience of Windows or the raw development power of Linux. WSL changes that. You get the best of both worlds, without the headache of dual-booting or buying a separate machine.If any part of my story resonated with you the frustration with setups, the curiosity about the command line, or the desire to feel more in command of your computer then my advice is simple: give WSL a try.\nFeeling inspired to jump in? Stay tuned for my next article, where I’ll walk you through the exact steps to install WSL and set up some essential utilities to begin your own journey.\n","description":"","id":"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/posts/wsl/","path":"/posts/wsl/","title":"The Best Windows Feature Isn't Made by Microsoft"},"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/projects/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/projects/","path":"/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/projects/project-1/":{"body":"Example project page\n","description":"a social network platform for collage students","id":"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/projects/project-1/","path":"/projects/project-1/","title":"Campus hive"}},"docInfo":{"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/":{"body":55,"description":0,"path":0,"title":1},"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/about/":{"body":13,"description":0,"path":0,"title":0},"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/posts/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/posts/turing/":{"body":956,"description":0,"path":2,"title":3},"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/posts/wsl/":{"body":521,"description":0,"path":2,"title":6},"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/projects/":{"body":0,"description":0,"path":1,"title":1},"https://dawnbreaker88.github.io/blog/projects/project-1/":{"body":3,"description":5,"path":3,"title":2}},"length":7},"lang":"English"}
