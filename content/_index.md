I write blogs that break down complex technical topics into clear, digestible insightsâ€”often using analogies, mental models, and real-world parallels to make them stick. From systems design and machine learning to deep computer science concepts, I explain things the way I wish someone had explained them to me. I also explore broader tech trends, ideas, and innovations shaping the field.

I donâ€™t write to impress. I write to clarify. If you're someone who wants to understand rather than just memorize, you're in the right place.
